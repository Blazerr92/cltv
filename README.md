# CLTV (CHECK\_LOCKTIME\_VERIFY)
CLTV is an op code in the Bitcoin scripting language that allows you to lock a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) 
by time. i.e. a coin cannot be spent until a certain time or blockchain height has been past.

To learn more about CLTV and how it works in Bitcoin, checkout [chapter 07 in Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch07.asciidoc)

This is the code for a corresponding guide to using CLTV with [bcoin](http://bcoin.io)
